# Software-Development-Project
Hello everyone! 

This is where we can work on our software development project. The final report and presentation is due on January 17th, 2022, but we'll plan on finishing it by sometime November to December maximum. 

## Ideas for a program/website that: 
helps organize your daily cycle with tips and advice

asks multiple questions and gives an answer (Like Akinator)

compiles news from news websites and refreshes it every day

provides a list of nearby restaurant/cafes with their menus and ratings based on your location (Not GPS, just PIN code)

## Programming languages we'll learn and use
Python

HTML and CSS?
