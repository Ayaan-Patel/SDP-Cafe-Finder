# Software-Development-Project
Hello everyone! 

This is where we can work on our software development project. The final report and presentation is due on January 17th, 2022, but we'll plan on finishing it early by sometime November to December maximum. 

## To do:

Decide whether to use simply Python or add HTML and CCS to the final product (its better to use all since it'll give a neater and more interactive program)

Learn to use Github properly and use it as evidence of work at the end of the year

Assign things to learn and work to do to each person

Decide on timelines of parts of the project

Use the Software Development Life Cycle and Waterfall model

Decide a team name

Make a project proposal of what we intend to develop with diagrams of relevant screens, flow charts, or other UMLs to communicate our vision for the product



## Ideas for the project: 

provides a list of nearby restaurant/cafes with their menus and ratings based on your location (Not GPS, just PIN code) Best an easiest idea to properly plan out

## Programming languages we'll learn and use
Python

HTML and CSS?
