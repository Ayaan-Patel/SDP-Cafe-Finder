# Welcome
This is where we can work on our software development project

## Project description: 
We decided to make a restaurant / caf√© finder to give an outline of nearby places to eat at. Initially we are planning this for TLK only, but we may expand it your personal GPS location if possible. It will display nearby restaurants along with their ratings, type of cuisine, pricing, open hours and their pictures. We're planning on making this unique with exclusive features later, and potentially a map displaying proximity.

## Programming languages we'll learn and use
HTML (Mostly Said and Ayaan)

CSS (Mostly Said and Ayaan)

SQL (Mostly Isabelle)
