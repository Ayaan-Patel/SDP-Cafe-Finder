# Welcome
This is where we can work on our software development project

This will be completed by December 7th. 

## To do:

Decide whether to use simply Python or add HTML and CCS to the final product (its better to use all since it'll give a neater and more interactive program)

Learn to use Github properly and use it as evidence of work at the end of the year

+ Make a project proposal of what we intend to develop with diagrams of relevant



## Ideas for the project: 
provides a list of nearby restaurant/cafes with their menus and ratings based on your location (Not GPS, just PIN code) 
+ Best an easiest idea to properly plan out

## Programming languages we'll learn and use
Python
