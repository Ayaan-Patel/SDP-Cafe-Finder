# Software-Development-Project
AP, GJ, IV, SZ's software development project for ICS3U, due on January 17th, 2022

## Ideas for a program/website that: 
helps organize your daily cycle with tips and advice

asks multiple questions and gives an answer (Like Akinator)

compiles news from news websites and refreshes it every day

provides a list of nearby restaurant/cafes with their menus and ratings based on your location (Not GPS, just PIN code)
